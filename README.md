# Tower-of-Hanoi
This project is an implementation of various search algorithms to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. The Tower of Hanoi, a classic problem in algorithm and puzzle solving, involves moving disks of different sizes from one peg to another, with the constraint that no larger disk can be placed on top of a smaller one.
